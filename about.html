      <h4>For Who?</h4>

      <div class="forWho">
        <p>This serves as a voice for individuals where gun violence is prevalent. These include proverty concentrated and underserved communities, POC (People of Color) communities (more specifically Black and Latine), schools, and the public as a whole. With the resources and support provided, I hope to garner the attention of lawmakers, gun owners, gun affiliated organizations (i.e. NRA), and anyone willing to listen.

        <h4 align=right>Why?</h4>

This only instills fear and panic to society, and I want to make sure that future generations will be able to feel safe and comfortable in public settings. For this reason, I decided to develop a website to spread awareness about the cause and compile resources where people can actively go in order to educate themselves and show support.</p>
